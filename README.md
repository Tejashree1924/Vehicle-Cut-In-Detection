VEHICLE CUT IN DETECTION

This repository contains a project focused on detecting vehicle cut-ins using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to identify vehicles from a provided video or image, calculate the distance between the detected vehicle and the target vehicle, and display a warning message if the vehicles are too close to each other.

TOOLS 

Python: Primary programming language for its extensive libraries.

PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.

YOLOv5: Real-time object detection model for vehicle detection.

OpenCV: Computer vision library for video capture, frame processing, and writing output files.

NumPy: Library for numerical operations and distance calculations.

PyCharm: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for efficient Python development.

cv2.VideoCapture: Captures video from files, sequences, or cameras.

cv2.VideoWriter: Writes processed video frames to a new video file.

These modules and tools were essential for setting up the environment, downloading and using pretrained models, processing images and videos, and visualizing the results.


Project Outcomes

The Vehicle Cut-In Detection project aims to enhance road safety by detecting potential collisions in real-time using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Here are the key outcomes of the project:

Real-Time Vehicle Detection

Distance Measurement and Collision Warning

Calculated the approximate distance between the detected vehicles and the target vehicle

Integration and Deployment

Designed the system to be easily adaptable for different types of vehicles and environments by retraining the model with custom datasets.
Ensured that the solution can be scaled to handle different video resolutions and frame rates without significant loss of performance.


The project leverages a combination of advanced machine learning models, robust computer vision libraries, and efficient data processing tools. The integration of these technologies ensures accurate vehicle detection, reliable tracking, and timely warning generation, making the system suitable for real-time applications such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The use of Python, PyTorch, YOLOv5, and OpenCV provides a powerful and flexible foundation for developing and enhancing vehicle detection and tracking systems.
